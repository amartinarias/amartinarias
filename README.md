### Hi there, my name is Alice and I transitioned into Technology in October 2021! 👋


<br>

🎃 I'm currently building my problem-solving, communication and interview skills through:

<br>

- ☁️ I'm currently learning Cloud Computing through the [She Builds CloudUp Cloud Practitioner program] (https://awsshebuildscloudupcpe.splashthat.com/).
- 💃 I'm currently a mentee at [Cajigo] (http://www.structur3dpeople.co.uk/cajigo/)
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my problem-solving skills and Python portfolio.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, more advanced Python concepts and Cloud Computing.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects and pair-programming.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with improving the quality of my code, refactoring and testing code.
- 💬 Ask me about problem-solving with Python, transitioning into tech, and becoming more organised.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love singing whilst driving but I'm a terrible singer!
